# Automator

This tool was initially created to automate the launch of tools to perform active recon', but it can be used for all kinds of task scheduling.


**_NOTE:_**  Yes, you can easily do the same by writing a bash script or likewise, but the goal was to have a bit more flexibility.


This tool only has a few defined parameters (help, config, parallel and color), you can define as many other parameters as you want to use as variables.

This project is still under development, so you will probably encounter bugs or limitations, please report them in the issues section of the project.

The config file used to explain the actions to be performed by the tool is based on JSON. Some examples of its syntax are present at the root of the project.

All remarks or suggestions are welcomed :)
